Our report works to assess the existence of a sixth mass extinction by examining current and past extinction rates. Our analysis is heavily inspired by the paper "Accelerated modern human–induced species losses: Entering the sixth mass extinction". 

## Assignment

All work for this assignment should be in the `assignment` directory.  

See our .Rmd output  with code [here](/assignment/extinction-assignment.Rmd)
See our formatted html report [here](/assignment/extinction-assignment.md)

## Reference files

### Common files

- `README.md` this file, a general overview of the repository in markdown format.  
- `.gitignore` :ignore common file types we don't want to accidentally commit to GitHub. Most projects should use this. 
- `2018-extinction-extinction-tanya-and-krista.Rproj`: R-Project file created by RStudio for it's own configuration.  


### Infrastructure for Testing

- `.travis.yml`: A configuration file for automatically running [continuous integration](https://travis-ci.com) checks to verify reproducibility of all `.Rmd` notebooks in the repo.  If all `.Rmd` notebooks can render successfully, the "Build Status" badge above will be green (`build success`), otherwise it will be red (`build failure`).  
- `DESCRIPTION` a metadata file for the repository, based on the R package standard. It's main purpose here is as a place to list any additional R packages/libraries needed for any of the `.Rmd` files to run.
